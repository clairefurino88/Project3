        <p>Hate&ampDate is an application to work under the principle that mutual dislikes bring people closer than shared interests.
        Almost every dating app collects information regarding people's passions and hobbies. However, even if you and
        a 'match' love many of the same things, if you disagree on one thing you hate, your match would be ruined. So instead,
        why not discuss what you hate? This application allows people to share stories in ten different categories about
        why they hate or what they hate about each category —including anything from Donald Trump to Traffic on a Monday
        Morning — using a blog forum. Hate&ampDate is a new and refreshing way to find a real match. Hate&ampDate is making
        online dating more approachable by replacing cumbersome surveys and bios with a fun, alternative way to express
        your personality.
